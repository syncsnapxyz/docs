# Seamless File upload from phone to web

SyncSnap is the easiest way to add **QR-based file uploads** to your application. A user on your website starts a transfer, scans a QR code with their phone, uploads a file, and your app receives it—no account or app install required.

## How it works

1. **Your web app** creates a transfer job and shows a QR code.
2. **The user** scans the QR code with their phone and is taken to the SyncSnap upload page.
3. **They select and upload** a file (e.g. a photo or document).
4. **Your app** calls a wait endpoint; the server polls until the job completes and returns a result (e.g. a secure download URL or custom payload).

No mobile app, no sign-in on the phone—just scan and upload.

## What you need

- A **SyncSnap** project and API key (get one in the [SyncSnap dashboard](https://syncsnap.xyz/dashboard)).
- **Backend**: the `syncsnap` server SDK to create jobs and proxy job/download requests.
- **Frontend**: the `@syncsnap/react` package for the upload button, QR code, and job polling.

## Frameworks

SyncSnap provides a first-party integration for **Next.js (App Router)**. The server SDK is Node-friendly and can be used with other frameworks by implementing the same API routes.
