# Cross-device uploads with a developer-first experience

SyncSnap helps users move from desktop to mobile capture in seconds. You ship a polished upload flow with fewer edge cases and no separate mobile app—one SDK, one API, and no account or app install required on the user's phone.

## How it works

1. **Embed once** — Add the SyncSnap SDK and render one component where uploads begin.
2. **Capture anywhere** — The user scans a QR code and switches to their phone for camera-friendly uploads.
3. **Continue your flow** — Files stream back to your app and the wait endpoint returns the result (e.g. presigned download URL or custom payload).

No mobile app, no sign-in on the phone—just scan and upload.

## What you need

- A **SyncSnap** project and API key from the [dashboard](https://syncsnap.xyz/dashboard).
- **Backend** — the `syncsnap` server SDK to create jobs and proxy job/download requests.
- **Frontend** — the `@syncsnap/react` package for the upload button, QR code, and job polling.

## Frameworks

SyncSnap provides a first-party integration for **Next.js (App Router)**. The server SDK is Node-friendly and can be used with other frameworks by implementing the same API routes.
