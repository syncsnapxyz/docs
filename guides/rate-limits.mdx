# Rate limits

The SyncSnap API applies rate limiting per project so that no single project can overwhelm the service. When the limit is exceeded, the API returns **429 Too Many Requests** with a JSON body and rate-limit headers (including when to retry).

## Limits

Limits are enforced **per project** (per API key), **per minute**, using a token-bucket algorithm (smooth rate, with burst up to the configured maximum).

| Scope           | Default          | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Per project** | 100 requests/min | All requests authenticated with the same project (API key). |

Only requests that are scoped to a project (e.g. job routes with a valid API key) are rate limited. Requests without a project are not limited by this middleware.

## Which endpoints are limited?

Rate limiting is applied to routes where a project is identified (e.g. after API key validation):

- **Auth** — API key validation and related auth routes.
- **Job** — Create job, get job, wait for completion, and get download URL.

Job creation, status checks, wait, and download requests all count toward the per-project limit.

## 429 response body

When rate limited, the API responds with:

```json
{
	"error": "rate limit exceeded: too many requests for this project"
}
```

HTTP status is always **429**. The response also includes [rate-limit headers](#response-headers) and `Retry-After` so clients know when to retry.

## Response headers

For requests that are scoped to a project, the API sets these rate-limit headers on **both successful and 429** responses:

| Header                   | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-rate-limit-limit`     | Maximum requests per minute allowed for this project.                                               |
| `x-rate-limit-remaining` | Number of requests remaining in the current window (0 when rate limited).                           |
| `x-rate-limit-reset`     | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the current rate-limit window resets (e.g. start of the next minute). |

On **429** responses only, the API also sets:

| Header        | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds until the window resets; wait this long before retrying. |

These headers are only present when the request is authenticated with a project.

## Handling rate limits in your app

- **Backend** — If your server proxies to SyncSnap and you get a 429, return a sensible status and message to the client (e.g. 429 with the same `error` body) so the frontend can show a “Too many requests, try again shortly” message.
- **Frontend** — Use [Error handling](/guides/error-handling): the React SDK’s `onError` and `error` state will receive failures from the wait endpoint. If the backend returns 429, the error message will reflect that; you can detect it (e.g. `err.message.includes('rate limit')`) and show a user-friendly message or retry after a short delay.

Example: surface rate-limit errors in the UI and suggest retrying:

```tsx
<SyncsnapUploadButton
	onError={(err) => {
		if (err.message.includes("rate limit")) {
			toast.error(
				"Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again.",
			);
		} else {
			toast.error(err.message);
		}
	}}
/>
```
