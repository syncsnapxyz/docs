# Styling the React SDK

Components in `@syncsnap/react` use **Tailwind CSS** and **CSS variables** for the theme. You can use the built-in theme or adapt it to your app.

## Option 1: Minimal setup (recommended)

If your app uses **Tailwind v4**, add these imports in your main CSS (e.g. `app/globals.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@syncsnap/react/theme";
```

The theme file includes an `@source` so Tailwind scans the SDK for class names. No extra config or copy-paste needed.

If you use **shadcn** or **tw-animate**, you may need:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";
@import "shadcn/tailwind.css";
@import "@syncsnap/react/theme";
```

Install peer deps if needed:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss tw-animate-css shadcn
```

## Option 2: Tailwind v3

Ensure Tailwind can see the SDK’s class names. In `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
content: [
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./node_modules/@syncsnap/react/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
```

Then in your global CSS:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@import "@syncsnap/react/theme";
```

## Option 3: Copy the full stylesheet

You can copy the SDK’s full styles (e.g. from the example app in this repo) into your project and import that instead. Use this if you want a single self-contained file or need to tweak the theme heavily.

## Requirements

- **Tailwind** (v3 or v4) so utility classes used by the components are generated.
- **Content scanning** of the SDK so classes like `bg-background`, `rounded-xl`, etc. are included (via `@source` in v4 or `content` in v3 config).

## Customizing the button

You can pass a `className` to `SyncsnapUploadButton` to style the wrapper or rely on your own button:

```tsx
<SyncsnapUploadButton
  className="my-4"
  buttonText="Scan to upload"
/>
```

For full control, use [useSyncsnapJob](/react/use-syncsnap-job) and [SyncsnapQrCode](/react/syncsnap-qr-code) and render your own button and layout.
