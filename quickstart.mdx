## Get started in three steps

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
2. Navigate to the `docs` directory and run: `mint dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.

### Step 2: Customize your docs

1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
2. Change the `"name"` and `"description"` to match your project.
3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
4. Save and see your changes at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 3: Deploy (optional)

Connect your repo to [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/start) and install the GitHub app to deploy automatically on push.

## Next steps

- Add more pages as `.mdx` files and reference them in `docs.json` under `navigation.tabs[].groups[].pages`.
- Use [Mintlify components](https://mintlify.com/docs/components) in your MDX for cards, code blocks, and more.
